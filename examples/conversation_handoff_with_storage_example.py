Example demonstrating conversation handoff between OpenAI and Claude agents with persistent storage.

This example shows how to:
1. Start a conversation with an OpenAI-powered MultiModalAgent
2. Save the conversation using AgentConversationManager with file storage
3. Load and continue the conversation with a Claude-powered MultiModalAgent
4. Persist the complete conversation history to files
